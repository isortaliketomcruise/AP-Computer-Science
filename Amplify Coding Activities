//AMPLIFY CODING ACTIVITIES
//Amplify sucks ass, so if you get code that works in eclipse but doesn't work in Amplify, feel free to Copy/Paste

//UNIT 1:

//Lesson 3 Coding Activity 1

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
String name;

System.out.println("What is your name?");
name = scan.nextLine();
System.out.println("Hi " + name + ", nice to see you.");

//Lesson 3 Coding Activity 2

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
String name1, name2, name3;

System.out.println("Please enter three names, all on different lines: ");
name1 = scan.nextLine();
name2 = scan.nextLine();
name3 = scan.nextLine();
System.out.println(name3 +" " + name2 +" " + name1); 

//Lesson 3 Coding Activity 3

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
String name, adj;

System.out.println("Hi there. What is your name?");
name = scan.nextLine();
System.out.println("What adjective describes you?");
adj = scan.nextLine();

System.out.println("My name is " + name + "." + " I am " + adj + "."); 

//Lesson 4 Activity 1

const int x = 4;

//Lesson 4 Activity 2

Choose "You cannot store a double in an int variable."

//Lesson 4 Activity 3

Choose: "char, int, double, String"

//Lesson 4 Activity 4

Choose: "double"

//Lesson 4 Activity 5

'

//Lesson 4 Activity 6

Write: Scanner

//Lesson 4 Activity 11

Choose: "-2147483648" //this is called a stack overflow. This is one number outside of int max range, so it flips to negative.

//Lesson 4 Activity 12

Choose: " and '

//Lesson 4 Coding Activity 1

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
double num1, num2;

System.out.println("Please enter two doubles.");
num1 = scan.nextDouble();
num2 = scan.nextDouble();

System.out.println(num2 + " " + num1);

//Lesson 4 Coding Activity 2

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

String name;
int age, yearsLeft;
int hundred = 100;

System.out.println("Hi there. What is your name?");
name = scan.nextLine();
System.out.println("Hi " + name + ". How old are you?");
age = scan.nextInt();
yearsLeft = hundred - age;
System.out.println(name + ", you will be 100 in " + yearsLeft + " years.");

//Lesson 5 Activity 1

Choose: x + 1

//Lesson 5 Activity 2

13.5

//Lesson 5 Activity 3

-15.0 //for some reason they say it's wrong if you put in -15... whatever fuck you Amplify.

//Lesson 5 Activity 3

-2

//Lesson 5 Activity 3

29

//Lesson 5 Coding Activity 1

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
double x, y, z;

System.out.println("Please enter two decimals.");
x = scan.nextDouble();
y = scan.nextDouble();
z = x - y;
System.out.println("The difference of your two decimals is " + z + "\n");

//Lesson 5 Coding Activity 2

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
int num1, num2, num3, num4, sum;

System.out.println("Please enter four integers.");
num1 = scan.nextInt();
num2 = scan.nextInt();
num3 = scan.nextInt();
num4 = scan.nextInt();

sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
System.out.println(sum);


//Lesson 5 Coding Activity 3

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
double rad, circ, area;
double pi = 3.14;

System.out.println("Enter a radius:");
rad = scan.nextInt();

circ = pi * 2 * rad;
area = pi * rad * rad;
System.out.println("Circumference: " + circ);
System.out.println("Area: " + area);

//Lesson 5 Coding Activity 4

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
double max = 20;
double price, newPrice;

System.out.println("Enter a price:");
price = scan.nextDouble();

newPrice = max - price;
System.out.println("Change from $20: $" + newPrice);
